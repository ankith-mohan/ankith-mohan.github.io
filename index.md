## About Me

I am a fifth-yer Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech advised by Prof. [Jamie Sikora](https://sites.google.com/site/jamiesikora). My research focuses on using techniques from optimization theory and machine learning towards solving problems in quantum computing.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my MS at [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/).
